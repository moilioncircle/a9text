Using TortoiseCVS together with Eclipse

The Eclipse IDE has a built-in SSH client, activated in its CVS browser 
by using the "extssh" protocol string. It's functionally equivalent to 
using the "ext" protocol string, but eliminates the need for an external 
SSH client. This is fine when only Eclipse is used, but as Tortoise 
doesn't support the protocol, only its offline features will be available. 

The official Eclipse documentation notes that "extssh" is incompatible 
with all other clients than Eclipse. The suggested solution is to 
configure "ext" to work in the same manner as "extssh" inside Eclipse, 
and then use "ext". See the link for details.

clipse has an extssh connection method which uses an internal SSH client. 
This method is incompatible with other CVS clients. To avoid this, 
users can configure the ext connection method in Eclipse to use the extssh 
connection method by choosing this option on the 
Team>CVS>EXT Connection Method preference page. Once set, 
the user can create repository locations using the ext connection method. 
These repositories will use extssh inside Eclipse and whatever SSH tool is 
configured for the command line client.
